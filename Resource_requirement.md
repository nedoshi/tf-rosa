I've created a cluster sizing guide. Summary of node requirements:

## Recommended Node Configuration

### Recommended: Small Production Cluster
3 worker nodes × m5.2xlarge (or equivalent)
- 8 vCPUs per node
- 32 GiB RAM per node
- Total: ~21 allocatable CPU cores, ~85 GiB allocatable memory

### Minimal: Demo/Development Cluster
3 worker nodes × m5.xlarge (or equivalent)
- 4 vCPUs per node
- 16 GiB RAM per node
- Total: ~10 allocatable CPU cores, ~40 GiB allocatable memory

## Resource Summary

Based on the updated script, your deployment requires approximately:
- Memory: ~10-12 GiB (application workloads)
- CPU: ~5-6 cores (5000-6000m)
- Persistent Storage: 35 GiB (ACS: 20Gi, TPA: 15Gi)

With OpenShift system overhead (~3-5 GiB memory, ~1.5-2.5 CPU cores), the minimal cluster will work for demos, while the recommended configuration provides better performance and headroom.

Created `CLUSTER_SIZING.md` with:
- Detailed resource breakdown by component
- Three sizing options with cost estimates
- AWS instance type recommendations
- Scaling considerations
- Verification commands

The optimized resource requests should fit comfortably on 3 × m5.2xlarge nodes with room for growth.
